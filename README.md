# 1. Introduction
The birth of the Auto Troubleshooting software came as a result of our experience in handling cases. We noticed that certain issues were recurring frequently, prompting us to consolidate them into an automated tool. This tool analyzes logs to identify highly suspicious or matching known software faults, presenting them in a comprehensive list. Furthermore, it provides users with references to previously resolved cases as valuable clues, thereby enhancing the speed of case resolution.

In addition, our software tool supports auto-update functionality, enabling automatic updates of both the software itself and the fault signature database. This ensures that users always have access to the latest features and solutions.

By harnessing the power of automation and providing an up-to-date knowledge base, the Auto Troubleshooting software significantly improves the efficiency of case handling and empowers users to tackle issues more effectively.

# 2. Software Installation Requirements:
This software is a lightweight application, currently occupying less than 10MB of disk space. It is compatible with all versions of the Windows operating system, ensuring that it can run seamlessly on any Windows platform.

# 3. Quick Start Guide


1) Extract and run the software. Upon launching, it will automatically download the latest resources from the server.
2) Select the Feature Category.
3) Choose the specific problem type (Analysis Item) you want to analyze. If there are no available analysis items, please email me, and I will continuously add new analysis models. The description (blue stamp 1) on the right side provides information about the current analysis requirements and log similarities.
4) Choose a folder. The tool will scan all subdirectories within the selected directory.
5) Click the Analysis button to initiate log analysis. The summary of the analysis results will be displayed in the text box (blue stamp 2) below.
6) You can use the Open Result and Save buttons to view and save the results.
By following these simple steps, you can quickly get started with the software and analyze logs to obtain summarized results.



# 4. How to Read and Interpret Analysis Results:
When you open the analysis results, you will see analysis sub-items starting with three equal signs (===). Each sub-item contains a name, the number of Find Results, and prompt messages. The prompt messages typically include relevant case numbers. Items starting with three dashes (---) represent matched entries, and the tool groups these matched entries based on predefined rules.

For example, in the screenshot below, the "Slow Live Access" issue is grouped under "Device Access Log," which facilitates the identification of specific devices.



By reviewing these analysis results, you can gain insights into the identified issues, the number of occurrences, and related information. This allows you to locate and address specific problems effectively.
